## Dataset Analysis

Datasets need to be analysed visually, numerically, statistically and in many other ways to draw correct
conclusions about the data at hand. The tools with which data is analysed as well as the result of the analysis
are stored here.

### Counter

Responsibilities: .CountValues() counts how many times a value occurs in a dataset and outputs the count to a
.cvs file, .CountMissingValues() counts how many times a missing value occurs in a dataset and outputs the
count to a .cvs file.

Pandas considers the following values missing: numpy.nan, Python None, 'missing', 'null'.

### GraphPainter

Responsibilities: paint a distribution, scatter and box graphs.
