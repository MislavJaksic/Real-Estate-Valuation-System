=====================

Problem
-------
In Croatia, real estate evaluation is expensive, takes a long time and is based on data hidden in a database unavailable to the public.

Requirements and functionalities
--------------------------------
Scrape real estate data from websites. (optional)
Store data for analysis.
Deleted data after it has been analysed.
Load data into data analysis tool.

Count the number of times a value has occured in each variable.
Count the number of missing values in each variable.
Draw graphs, distribution, boxes, scatter.
Transform data based on values.

Construct a prediction model using machine learning.
Predict the price of an unknown property.

Specify property data through a graphical interface.
Receive price prediction through a graphical interface.

Architecture
------------
Program organisation - the system id divided into the following parts: DatasetSources, DatasetAnalysis, DatasetTransformation, Graphical User Interface (GUI), 
Major classes -
Data design - Data is stored in a database called MongoDB. I'm using a database instead of a .cvs file is beasue I want to learn how to use a database. I chose MongoDB because I've found a driver that allows me to access it through Python. PostgreSQL was considered due to its popularity.
